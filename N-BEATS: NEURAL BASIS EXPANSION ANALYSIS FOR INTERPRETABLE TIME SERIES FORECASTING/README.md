Apart from classical model, I have read latest paper which introduce us to a novel deep interpretable architecture that achieves state of the art on three large scale univariate time series forecasting datasets (i.e. ***N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting***  published in ***ICLR 2020***). The paper focuses on solving the univariate times series point forecasting problem using deep learning. The paper propose a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully-connected layers. The architecture has a number of desirable properties, being interpretable, applicable without modification to a wide array of target domains, and fast to train. the paper test the proposed architecture on several well-known datasets, including M3, M4 and TOURISM competition datasets containing time series from diverse domains. The demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for two configurations of N-BEATS for all the datasets, improving forecast accuracy by 11% over a statistical benchmark and by 3% over last year's winner of the M4 competition, a domain-adjusted hand-crafted hybrid between neural network and statistical time series models. The paper investigates a pure deep learning architecture for Univariate time series analysis by simply ensembling feed-forward networks, along with the residual stacking mechanism for fluid learning. Each of the generic block consists of 4 FC layers followed by the use of forward and backward predictor to have forecast and backcast output of the original input. These blocks forms the stacks, where each stack provides the residuals and the forecast responses further to the next stacks, which ultimately provide the global forecast. To make the internal stack outputs interpretable, assumptions are imposed on the trend model, which follows a polynomial function of time vector, and seasonality model which follows periodic Fourier series. Further, the ensembling of models based on different metrics and input windows is used for better accuracy
